# pands-project

## Instructions to reader. 

Please follow my Jupyter Notebook for comments and explainations of analysis. 

Download analysis.py to run the code yourself.

When you run the code, a folder name "Plots" will be created in the directory you save analysis.py in and plots will be saved here. 

Logistic Regression accuracy/KNN model with best accuracy will be outputed. 

You will be asked to input Iris measurements and will be given the predicted Species based on these measurements.
