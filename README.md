## Instructions to reader. 

Please follow my Jupyter Notebook for comments and explainations of analysis. 

Download analysis.py to run the code yourself.

Code blocks have been separated into functions, which are referenced in my Jupyter Notebook. 

When running the code it is best to run function call 1, 2 and 3 seperately. Code is commented out to use uncomment and when done comment out again.
